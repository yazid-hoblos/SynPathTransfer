# SynPathTransfer ðŸ§¬ðŸš€  
*A computational toolkit for transferring and optimizing metabolic pathways in cyanobacteria and beyond.*

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
**SynPathTransfer** is a bioinformatics pipeline designed to support synthetic biologists in **pathway transplantation tasks**, with an initial focus on transferring the **3-hydroxypropionate (3HP) cycle** to cyanobacteria as a way to bypass the inefficiencies of RuBisCO.

The tool provides a **generalizable framework**: given any metabolic pathway and a candidate host genome, it evaluates feasibility, highlights engineering requirements, and proposes optimization strategies â€” from gene presence/absence checks to flux simulations and omics integration.

## âœ¨ Features
It consists of six interconnected modules:

1. **Pathway Coverage Audit**  
   - Input: pathway (KEGG/MetaCyc ID) + genome/proteome of host strain.  
   - Checks which enzymes already exist, which are missing, and suggests donor orthologs.  
   - Flags membrane/oxygen-sensitive enzymes.  
   - Outputs a gene-by-reaction report for wet-lab design.

2. **Pangenomic Chassis Selector**  
   - Compares multiple cyanobacterial (or other microbial) strains.  
   - Identifies the best host based on gene content, accessory genome, and available genetic tools.  
   - Produces a ranked list of recommended chassis.

3. **Enzymeâ€“Host Compatibility Predictor**  
   - Scores candidate enzymes based on sequence similarity, cofactor usage, oxygen tolerance, solubility, thermodynamics, and expression burden.  
   - Helps choose the most compatible version of missing enzymes.

4. **Flux Balance Analysis (FBA)**  
   - Integrates the pathway into genome-scale metabolic models (SBML).  
   - Simulates growth/product trade-offs and identifies potential bottlenecks.  
   - Supports Pareto front exploration for design decisions.

5. **Multi-Omics Refinement**  
   - After initial wet-lab transfer, integrates transcriptomics and proteomics data.  
   - Builds condition-specific models to pinpoint real bottlenecks (regulation vs thermodynamics).  

6. **Pyruvate Valorization Module**  
   - Addresses the **excess pyruvate** often generated by the 3HP cycle.  
   - Automatically identifies and ranks downstream pathways to valorize pyruvate (e.g., lactate, ethanol, butanol, isoprene, PHB).  
   - Scoring considers thermodynamics, redox balance, ATP, toxicity, pathway length, and literature precedent.
