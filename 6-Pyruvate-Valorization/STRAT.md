# Main Strategy

0. The goal is to make something out of the excess pyruvate
1. First we need to search for pathways diverging from pyruvate
2. Second we assess the cost of each pathway based on different factors
3. Third we assess the benefit from the end product of each pathway and weight the cost against the benefit
4. Finally we try to generalize this module to any molecule not only pyruvate  


## 1. Crackshay Pathway Search


## 2. Cost Assessment  

Given a list of pathways we want to assess the cost of each
